# Popup Message
You can use a Snackbar to display a brief message to the user. The message automatically goes away after a short period. A Snackbar is ideal for brief messages that the user doesn't necessarily need to act on. For example, an email app could use a Snackbar to tell the user that the app successfully sent an email.
